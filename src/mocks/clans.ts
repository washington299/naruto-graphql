		description: `The Aburame Clan (油女一族, Aburame Ichizoku) is one of the four noble clans of Konohagakure.[1] At birth, members of this clan are offered to several special breeds of insects as a nest, residing just under their host's skin. These insects will then live in symbiosis with their host from that point on. Because of this, its members are characterised by their use of insects as weapons.
			The clan members may also carry additional insects in jars or gourds with them on missions. The insects can leave and enter their host's body through various pores. They feed on chakra as a food source, making them quite deadly. The relationship between the shinobi and the insects is mutually beneficial.

It has had fifteen family heads, with Chōza Akimichi being the fifteenth. Chōji Akimichi is slated to become the sixteenth head.
			Members of the clan possess great physical strength and are able to quickly convert calories into chakra, which they then use in their various secret techniques. Most of these techniques rapidly consume the user's chakra during use, and maintaining them during a prolonged battle can be tiring. For this reason the Akimichi have high chakra levels and eat a lot in order to build up or replenish their chakra reserves.

This ability however seems to require that they stay hydrated at all time, so they carry water bottles around with them. They also specialize in Ice Style ninjutsu and taijutsu and the one known as "Ice Fist". Since the clan follows the ways of the Ice Dragons, they are basically Ice Dragon Wielders.
			The Hozuki were one of the clans responsible in the founding of Kirigakure, along with the Gyokana Clan and befriended the Senju Clan, Terumi Clan, and Yuki Clan.

Members of this clan also possess an innate ability which allows them to expel chakra from any of the tenketsu in their body.
			The Hyūga clan are descendants from the Ōtsutsuki clan, specifically from Hamura Ōtsutsuki's lineage. As a result, they are also distant cousins of the Uchiha, Senju, Uzumaki, and Kaguya clans. They are considered to be one of, if not currently, the most powerful clan in Konohagakure. Their fame and prowess stretches far and wide, leading others to both praise and covet their abilities. During the Fourth Shinobi World War, a Kumo-nin noted that they had a hard time against them during a previous war.

			Years before the start of the series, they led an attempted invasion by Iwa of Konohagakure, only to be repelled and largely killed by Konoha's more experienced Aburame clan. The Kamizuru were so badly defeated that they lost their status and respect in Iwa and their numbers began to dwindle.

Agari's servants copied Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata's appearances and left them trapped in the cave while they left to go "mess up their village." The one posing as Naruto gave the real one a hard time and Kiba managed to take down Agari and the Kedōin clan members impersonating him and Hinata. Naruto finally defeated his impostor using the Shadow Clone Technique. Moments later in Tsunade's office, Tsunade revealed that she hired Agari to test the genin's teamwork and to see if they should be sent back to the Academy or not. Naruto, Kiba, and Hinata passed and collected the treasure chest, which contains the bill for Tsunade.

			The deceased members of this clan were later revived as zombies by their killers and used in Furido's attack on Konohagakure.
			Despite having their own village, the clan was also seen to be affiliated with Konoha, since one of their revived members was seen wearing a Konoha flak jacket. The members had the symbol of black futatsudomoe (double tomoe shaped like yin and yang) tattooed on their upper arm with two lines going around it.

		description: `The Kurama Clan (鞍馬一族, Kurama Ichizoku) is a clan of extremely skilled genjutsu users, exclusive to the anime. This talent in genjutsu is due to the kekkei genkai that the clan possesses. However, once every few generations, a member of the clan will be born with such enormous skill in genjutsu that their illusions causes the brain to make anything that happens to the victim within the genjutsu physically real, allowing the clan member to potentially kill their opponents with genjutsu.
			Such frightening power is not without its drawbacks, however. The user can rarely control the full extent of their abilities, and as such their subconscious will often regulate that power, leading to the creation of a second personality in control of that power. This personality then overwhelms the original, turning the individual into a monster that is a danger to everyone that surrounds them. They were originally one of the more prominent clans in Konohagakure, but the number of ninja in the clan has severely dwindled.

After Shikaku's death, Shikamaru became the head of the clan.
			The clan has kept a book with various medicine preparations and effects for generations, implying that they are skilled in the area of medicine and healing arts. Among the medicine described in this book are the secret pills used by the Akimichi clan. The Nara also have a special bond with the deer of the Nara Clan Forest, and only members of the clan are allowed inside without the deer attacking unless an outsider is given permission.

By surviving their respective matches, they proved themselves to be the strongest of Orochimaru's prisoners and as such were made his bodyguards. The Sound Four were at some point forced to accept Kimimaro as their leader, who easily defeated them all in battle and, because of his Shikotsumyaku abilities, was slated to be Orochimaru's next host body.

As such, three Senju have achieved the position of Hokage.
			As descendants of Asura Ōtsutsuki, the Senju inherited his powerful life force and chakra, and through Hashirama Senju eventually manifested as Wood Release. It was thought that the Senju's strength was based in love. Compared to other shinobi clans, the Senju didn't specialise in just one area, instead mastering ninjutsu, taijutsu, and genjutsu to give themselves a wide variety of skills to combat their enemies.

He and the clan members were met with resistance at the village, and thus, they attacked and killed a majority of them. Menma panicked and tried to escape, but ended up falling off a cliff and losing his memory. He was later saved by Naruto.
			Later, during their final attack on the village, the members were all defeated.
