			Kumogakure (雲隠れの里, Kumogakure no Sato, English TV: Hidden Cloud Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Clouds) is the hidden village of the Land of Lightning and was founded by the First Raikage. As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Kumogakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Raikage, of which there have been five in its history. The village is located in a range of tall mountains, and is literally hidden in the clouds. The Raikage works in a large blue structure built into the tallest mountain.
			The standard attire for Kumo shinobi consists of a long, grey top which gathers just at the waist to give a sash-like appearance, with a matching coloured bottom. Over this they wear white, one-strapped flak jackets and arm as well as shin-guards. Many Kumogakure ninja use Lightning Release techniques. `,

It was founded approximately one hundred years ago by a man named Seimei. Takumi is known for its skills in making weaponry, many of which are sold to the ninja villages of the world. However, each time relations worsened between the larger villages, Takumi was attacked by one village over fear of their ninja tools crossing to the other village. Yet they still had to curry aid with the larger villages to survive. Over time, their clientele from the other villages grew in skill, making the crafted weapons obsolete. When the village faced hard times they requested help but were ignored. Certain skilled Takumi villagers grew resentful and felt the villages didn't respect them for all the help their weapons provided in the past, having repaid their aid with attacks in the past. `,

		description: `Kusagakure (草隠れの里, Kusagakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden in the Grass) is located thus far in an unnamed country. Because it had genin participating in the Chūnin Exams organised by Konohagakure, it can be assumed the two villages are allied. Although it has never been named, the country Kusagakure is located in has been shown on several occasions. The country is rich with forests, some consisting of giant mushrooms or bamboo. It also seems to have many rivers and deep ravines.
			During the Third Shinobi World War, the country was invaded by Iwagakure and served as an important front between Iwa and Konoha. More than a decade later, Orochimaru had a hideout somewhere in the country.
			Kusagakure is skilled in diplomacy, a trait they constantly use to read the movements of other countries and stay one step ahead of them. They also analyse techniques from other villages in a similar manner. Because of these principles, others find it hard to read the shinobi from this village's attitudes.

Thirty years before the start of the series, it was at war with Konoha. Three months after a surprise attack by the Third Hokage, Jiraiya and several other Konoha ninja, they declared a cease-fire. Two weeks later, however, they were wiped out by shinobi from Tanigakure. Only Gennō, who had been in Konoha at the time planting explosive tags for a possible counter-attack, survived its destruction. `,

		description: `Yugakure (湯隠れの里, Yugakure no Sato, literally meaning: Village Hidden in Hot Water) is the hidden village of the Land of Hot Water. Like the country in which it resides, Yugakure has strong inclinations towards pacifism. After years of reluctantly offering combat-related services, Yugakure officially transitioned away from the typical shinobi missions; it prides itself as the "village that has forgotten wars" (戦を忘れた里, Ikusa o Wasureta Sato). The village's ninja now work almost exclusively within the Land of Hot Water's borders, keeping the roads safe for tourists and performing odd-jobs for the many small settlements around the country.
			Yugakure's transformation from a military force was not supported by all, Hidan being a notable objector. A follower of Jashin, Hidan believed violence was good, even necessary; when he couldn't convince the village to change its ways, he became a missing-nin, slaughtering many of his fellow Yu-nin before he left.

			The standard attire for Konoha shinobi consists of blue or black shirts which may or may not have swirl patterns on the shoulders, along with matching coloured pants under a green flak jacket which also has a red swirl on the back, and pockets on the chest area. They also tend to wrap bandages around their legs. Many Konohagakure ninja use Fire Release techniques.

This village's shinobi are experts in espionage in order to gain information for negotiations with larger, more powerful nations. In this village, ninja seem to be specifically trained in gaining information while giving none in return as evident by Hanare's Eye Mind Reading technique and their leader's willingness to commit suicide rather than be taken hostage by enemy ninja.`,

Underneath this, they wear a full-black shirt and pants over which they wear the villages' standard grey flak jacket. Some also wear waist-guards. Many Kiri ninja use Water Release techniques. Due to the village's high number of missing-nin, Kiri has a subdivision of Anbu known as hunter-nin that are specifically tasked with eliminating these defectors.

			Ame ninja are said to be notoriously short tempered, while their village trains them to their fullest potential, resulting in the creation of many original techniques. Ame is frequently hired for assassination missions, an area of expertise prized by many countries. A common trait of shinobi from this village is wearing rebreathers. Its shinobi also have a propensity for genjutsu.

As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Iwagakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Tsuchikage, of which there have been four in its history. The rocky mountain ranges that surround the village provide a natural stronghold that it is very proud of. The village's infrastructure is built from much of the surrounding rock and stone, shaped into tower-like structures that are inter-connected by a network of bridges. The Tsuchikage's residence seems to be the tallest structure with a cone-shaped roof and bears the kanji for "Earth" (土, Tsuchi) on it.
			The standard attire for Iwa shinobi consists of red outfit — which can either have one, or both sleeves — a lapel which is usually found on the side without a sleeve and a brown flak jacket — which also may, or may not have a pouch attached to it. They also tend to wear mesh armour around their ankles. Many Iwagakure ninja use Earth Release techniques. Iwagakure is well-known for the rock-hard attitude of its shinobi; as soon as the Tsuchikage gives an order, the Iwa-nin follow it without hesitation, even if it means death

Being surrounded by desert offers the village a natural deterrent against invasion, as few foreign powers would be willing to endure the sandstorms and water scarcity common to Suna. Sunagakure itself lies in a fortified valley behind cliffs of rock, with passage in and out of the village restricted to a single cleft between two cliff faces, making the area very hard to attack from the ground. The buildings inside seem to be made of clay or stucco, which would help to keep the buildings cool.`,

		Around the time of the village's formation, the village tasked Kakuzu with assassinating Hashirama Senju, the First Hokage. Facing the might of the Wood Release, Kakuzu returned in failure. Despite the insurmountable danger faced on this mission, what awaited his return to his village was the stigma and harsh punishment associated with the failure of his objective. In response to this treatment, a wrong levied against a shinobi who had put life and limb on the line for his village, Kakuzu came to hold a violent hatred for Takigakure as he escaped from imprisonment. In his flight from the village, Kakuzu killed the village elders, took their hearts, and fled with knowledge of the village's most prized forbidden techniques.

In terms of appearance, the village seemed to have been composed of several high-rise buildings. A wide river seemingly ran through the village and was gapped by large bridges. The surrounding countryside was dominated by steep hills.
